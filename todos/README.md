Sorry, I have seen that I used method "POST" instead of "PUT" to update todo and to mark/unmark todo


In order to get all todos use "GET /tasks"

In order to update todo use "POST /tasks:task_id"

In order to create new todo use "POST /create"

In order to mark todo as done use "POST /mark"

In order to unmark todo as done use "POST /unmark"
